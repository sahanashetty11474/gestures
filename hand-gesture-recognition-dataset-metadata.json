For training purpose, there are 900 images in each directory and for testing purpose there are 300 images in each directory. This dataset primarily use for hand gesture recognition task. I have also done a project for Gesture Controlled Opencv Calculator. The link for the project - [https://github.com/rishabh-arya/Gesture-controlled-opencv-calculator](https://github.com/rishabh-arya/Gesture-controlled-opencv-calculator).\n\nIf you find useful this dataset and please upvote it.......\uD83D\uDE04\uD83D\uDE04 \n\n\n"}
